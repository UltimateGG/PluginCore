# PluginCore
PluginCore is built off of **Bukkit 1.15.2**

Bukkit is used so that this core should work for any Minecraft version.
The Bukkit API is a wrapper for the Minecraft server, so it should work for any version
as the API method names are the same.

This is *not* a plugin itself, but a base for plugins to be built off of to make development easier.
This library provides a lot of utilities and startup code I use in my plugins.
